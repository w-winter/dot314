## What to include
- **Context**: what we were trying to accomplish and why
- **Current state**: what is implemented/working right now
- **Key decisions & constraints**: APIs chosen, patterns to follow, gotchas
- **Files & code hotspots**: paths and what they contain (only important ones)
- **Open questions / risks**: unknowns, edge cases, failures encountered
- **Next steps**: concrete, ordered checklist for continuing

## Style
- Be concise but high-density
- Prefer bullets and short sections
- Include exact file paths / commands only when they materially help
