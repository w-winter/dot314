# .π

Extensions, skills, prompts, and themes for [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).  There is an emphasis here on making Pi and [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com) co-operate well.

> This is a personal collection.  Some items are original, some adapted from the Pi community, some used unadapted.  It's tailored to my workflow and may introduce breaking changes without notice.  Unadapted items may lag well behind their upstream versions.  Extensions published as [Pi packages](#install-individual-extensions-from-npm) receive more careful maintenance.

## Provenance key

- ● → new
- ◐ → from Pi community, modified
- ○ → from Pi community, unmodified

## Quick start

```bash
pi install git:github.com/w-winter/dot314    # install the package
pi config                                     # enable/disable individual extensions and themes
```

Or try it for a single run without installing:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/w-winter/dot314
```

## Installation

### Install as a Pi package

**Requires Pi 0.50.0+** (see [packages.md](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/packages.md))

Install from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/w-winter/dot314
# (or with the raw URL)
pi install https://github.com/w-winter/dot314
```

Project-local install (writes to `.pi/settings.json`):

```bash
pi install -l git:github.com/w-winter/dot314
```

After installing, use `pi config` to enable/disable individual extensions, skills, and themes. You can also filter in `settings.json` - for example:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "git:github.com/w-winter/dot314",
      "extensions": [
        "extensions/repoprompt-mcp/src/index.ts",
        "extensions/rp-native-tools-lock/index.ts",
        "extensions/session-ask/index.ts",
        "extensions/anycopy/index.ts"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `!path` to exclude specific extensions, or list only the ones you want. See [package filtering](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/packages.md#package-filtering) for the full syntax.

Notes:
- `pi install ...` runs `npm install` in the package root automatically
- Some extensions store optional per-user config under `~/.pi/agent/extensions/<extension-name>/...` (e.g. `poly-notify`, `sandbox`, `tools`, `rp-native-tools-lock`). These files are not part of the package install and are created on-demand or are optional

### Install individual extensions from npm

If you only want one extension, you can install the per-extension npm packages (see [`packages/`](packages/) in this repo).

Example:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-repoprompt-cli
```

All available npm packages:

### What the Pi package includes

This repo contains more resources than the package exports. When installed as a Pi package, Pi will discover only the resources declared in [`package.json`](package.json):

### Manual / symlink setup

If you prefer a local working-copy workflow, clone this repo anywhere:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:w-winter/dot314.git ~/path/to/dot314-agent
```

Then symlink what you want into `~/.pi/agent/`:

```bash
# Example: add one extension (single-file)
ln -s ~/path/to/dot314-agent/extensions/move-session.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/

# Example: add all skills from this repo
ln -s ~/path/to/dot314-agent/skills/* ~/.pi/agent/skills/
```

Pi scans `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`, `skills/`, and `prompts/` for resources.
