> Safe, token-efficient git abstraction for MCP agents.
> 
> Ops:
> - status: Repository state (branch, upstream, ahead/behind, staged/modified/untracked)
> - diff: View changes (summary by default, full on demand, optionally writes artifacts)
> - log: Commit history with stats
> - show: Single commit details
> - blame: Line attribution
> - list: List snapshots
> - get: Read a snapshot by snapshot_id (or "current")
> - delete: Delete a snapshot
> - prune: Delete snapshots older than N days
> 
> Compare specs (for diff/show):
> - uncommitted (default): Working dir vs HEAD
> - staged: Staged vs HEAD
> - unstaged: Working dir vs staged
> - back:N: HEAD~N..HEAD
> - last: Working dir vs CURRENT snapshot head SHA
> - <snapshot_id>: Working dir vs snapshot head SHA
> - <revspec>: Any git revspec (e.g., main...HEAD)
> 
> Detail levels (for diff):
> - summary (default): Totals only
> - files: File list with stats
> - full: Complete patches with hunks
> 
> Safety: All commands use --no-ext-diff, --no-textconv, --color=never, GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0.
